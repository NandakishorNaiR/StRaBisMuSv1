# 👁️ Strabismus Detection System

## 📌 Overview

This project is an AI-powered system that detects **strabismus (eye misalignment)** from facial images using deep learning.

The model analyzes eye alignment and classifies the image into:

* Normal
* Esotropia
* Exotropia
* Hypertropia
* Hypotropia

The system then determines whether the person has **normal vision or strabismus**.

## 🚀 Features

* 🔍 Detects **Normal vs Strabismus**
* 🧠 Multi-class classification of eye conditions
* 📊 Displays **class probabilities**
* 📈 Visualizes predictions with **probability graph**
* 🌐 Deployed using Gradio (Hugging Face Spaces)
* ⚡ Fast and interactive UI

## 🧠 Model Details

* Model: MobileNetV2 (Transfer Learning)
* Framework: TensorFlow / Keras
* Input Size: 224 × 224
* Output: 5 classes

## 🌐 Deployment

This project is deployed using **Gradio on Hugging Face Spaces**.

👉 Live Demo: https://octane12v1-strabismus.hf.space/?__theme=system&deep_link=qjYHTZBxsAc

## 🧪 How It Works

1. Upload an image
2. Image is preprocessed (resized and normalized)
3. Model predicts probabilities for each class
4. System selects the **highest probability class (argmax)**
5. Output:

   * Final prediction (Normal / Strabismus)
   * Predicted class
   * Confidence score
   * Probability graph

---

## 📊 Example Output

* Prediction: NORMAL
* Confidence: 92.45%
* Graph showing class probabilities
